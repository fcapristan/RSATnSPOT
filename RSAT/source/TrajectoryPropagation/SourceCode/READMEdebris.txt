This folder contains the required files to run the debris propagator
just source the "sourceME4python.txt" file.
This routine will required some input for atmospheric parameters

For atmospheric parameters I have coupled a modified debris routine with NASA's GRAM model. To get the executable that acquires the atmospheric data just type "make" in the subfolder debrisGRAM. The GRAM source code cannot be further distributed (sorry you need your own copy). The GRAM source code in this folder includes:
GRAMAtmos.f90
Cfiles_E10_C.f90
Ifiles_E10_I.f90
gramtraj_E10.f90
trajcalc_E10.f90
gramsubs_E10.f90
initial_E10.f90
MET07prg_E10.f90
model_E10.f90
random_E10.f90
rramods_E10.f90
MISISsubs_E10.f90
JB2008_E10.f90
NCEPsubs_E10.f90



In case you don't have access to GRAM other atmospheric data could easily be used, just input the data in the debris propagator.
