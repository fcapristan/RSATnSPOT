SAMPLE SPOT CASE
to run type:

python runTrajectory.py input_STOP.dat

SPOT allows to generate optimal trajectories with a given launch window. It writes the results to different text files e.g Traj1.txt.
A python dictionary of the entire trajectory can be loaded using cPickle with 'solList.txt'
The different parameters in the dictionary are defined in 'dictionaryDefinitions.py'
 

runTrajectory.py couples the different routines to run SPOT. It starts with optimizing with a lower number of points, it then adds points until the desired number is obtained.
Check optWanings.txt for convergence issues.
